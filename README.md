This paper presents a chord recognition method  through analysis of a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) as well as  a method for improving the calculation speed of said DFT.  Research was conducted using a DE1-SoC and its hardware  limitations inspired methods for reducing the number of  calculations required to calculate a DFT. Down sampling the  signal is investigated as a method to improve processing times  while still maintaining enough meaningful data for accurate  analysis. A novel method of chord identification from a DFT is  presented involving the utilization of overtones and knowledge of western music chord structure. Down sampling of an audio signal  may expedite chord recognition as well as other forms of musical  analysis. This research was evaluated using individual chords  played on an electric piano connected to a DE1-SoC.
